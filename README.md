# Notes

This project is meant as an excuse for me to learn Java, Git, Unit Testing, Build Tools (Maven), IDEs (VSCode/IntelliJ) and best practices in Object Oriented Design.

I recognize that there may be a better way to do some of this. If you have an idea, I would encourage you to submit a pull request with your proposed changes and enhancements. I would appreciate the feedback.

I'm attempting to consume a large quantity of technologies all at once. All of which are new to me. Guess I'm doing a bit of jumping straight into the deep end of the pool and trying to learn how to swim. I expect to make little mistakes along the way.

Ideally, this code could be used as a module or external library within a GUI app. Someday, as a goal, I'll move in this direction.
